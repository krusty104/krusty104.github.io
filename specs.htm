lying around. It's probably a little over-the-top for arcade emulation, but

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The speakers are 
fantastic for budget sound ... Bright, clear &amp; crisp with plenty of oomph, 
better than some more expensive floor-standing hi-fi speakers; I'd recommend 
them to anyone. As far as the monitor goes, the bigger the better, and this was the 
biggest I could afford.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">I decided to go with a 
Windows setup rather than a DOS one for ease of configuration (hehe ... some 
people would disagree!). Also, Visual Pinball only runs under Windows, so I 
would not have been able to include it (See below).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The Windows 
environment also allowed me to create my own Startup Menu using a program called 
'Autoplay Menu Studio'. The program was originally intended for creating Autorun 
programs for your CD's, but it can be adapted to produce menus for just about 
anything.</font></p>

</table>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">To anyone who hasn't 
investigated Daphne and Visual Pinball, I suggest you go to my Links page and 
check them out. Daphne pairs the Laserdisc classics with the original Arcade 
roms, so it's as arcade-authentic as it gets. Some dedicated guys have used 
Visual Pinball to recreate classic Arcade pinball tables, even incorporating the 
backglass display animations. Top stuff!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">As far as frontends 
go, Game Launcher is not that easy to configure, but I like the look and feel of 
it, and it is easily customised for the different emulators. You can select your 
games from the menus using either the Joystick or the Mouse to scroll through 
the lists, a feature that most Windows-based frontends struggle with in my 
opinion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">I should also point 
out here that the current versions of Game Launcher (0.9.8) and Visual Pinball 
(6.1) don't like each other much. I had to use a program called 'AutoIT' to 
generate a Windows script file and create an individual batch file for <u>every</u> 
table in order to get it working smoothly (a very time-consuming and laborious 
process, but very rewarding in the end).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The Nebula Model 2 
arcade emulator is not quite yet mature, but there are a number of games that it 
supports that are fully playable and are not yet included in M.A.M.E, such as 
House of the Dead. This one's for emulation freaks only, as it's not easily 
configured for use in a cabinet and there is very little documentation for it, 
online or otherwise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">As I am using hacked 
Sidewinder gamepads for my controls, the RB-Joy software allows me to control 
the mouse pointer with the joystick(s) and re-map the buttons to keypresses and 
mouse clicks. M.A.M.E doesn't need the key re-map feature, but Visual Pinball 
does at this stage as it does not accept joystick button input.</font></p>
