<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Cabinet Construction:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">After spending a few 
weeks ringing Arcade suppliers and looking around at second hand cabinets, I 
decided that I couldn't really get what I wanted out of one. I wanted my beast 
to be big and imposing, and the ones that suited my purpose were outside my 
budget. It became apparent that it would be cheaper to build one myself rather 
than buy an old shell. Boy, was that wrong!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The whole thing is 
built out of 18mm MDF sheets and good old 2x4. It stands approx 2 metres tall 
and about 80cm wide, which looked ok in the garage during construction, but our 
house has a lower ceiling than the garage, so it dominates the room inside.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">I cut most of the 
pieces I needed using a jigsaw and sanded them back to the lines I'd drawn. This 
was a very slow method, but the best I could manage without a full tool shop 
behind me. The frame is screwed together using big hex bolt (allen key) wood 
screws, and I've got an allen key adapter for my cordless drill, so the whole 
thing can be disassembled/reassembled in about an hour or so. Just as well, 'cos 
it doesn't fit through any doorways! Think I'll be leaving it where it is for a 
while.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The front door is 
mounted on piano hinge with a keyed lock, so I can keep my brother's kids out of 
the guts. There is no access via the back panel unless you take it off.</font></p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/InCab.jpg">
<img border="0" src="images/InCabThumb.jpg" width="160" height="120"></a></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00">Front Door Open</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Control Panel:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The Control Panel is 
held in place by 4 coach bolts, 2 horizontal and 2 vertical, screwed through the 
2x4 supports. This prevents it from moving at all, even during the most 
aggressive gameplay.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Seeing as I had one 
lying around, I decided to get another Sidewinder game pad and hack the two of 
them to provide input for the joysticks and buttons. The Sidewinders have 10 
button inputs each, so hooking them both up provided me with 20 usable buttons 
and 2 joysticks. The Sidewinder is also easily recognised by Windows, so there 
were no configuration and calibration hassles. See the links page.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">I wanted to include a 
sliding keyboard drawer in the Control Panel, but I must've got my measurements 
wrong and the one I had didn't fit once the joysticks and buttons were 
installed. They have a low clearance, so if you intend to do the same thing, 
allow plenty of vertical room. The front door is also mounted on piano hinge 
with a keyed lock.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The joysticks are Happ 
Supers, and the buttons and microswitches are all from Happ Controls as well. I 
ordered them through The Real Bob Roberts (see the links page). This guy gives 
great service, I highly recommend him. The two smaller red buttons are for 
Escape and Insert Coin, and were cheapos I got from local electronics stores.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">I intend to add a 
spinner at some stage (most likely the Slikstik Tornado) for games like Arkanoid 
and Tempest, and possibly an ACT Labs Light Gun as well for shooting games.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#FFFF00">UPDATE 01/01/2004: I 
now have the ACT Labs Light Gun (PC Monitor USB version). My wife has now 
ditched Tetris, and plays 'Bang!' in MAME at every opportunity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#FFFF00">UPDATE 20/09/2004: I 
now have the Slikstik Tornado Spinner installed, herein referred to in this 
website as &quot;My Knob&quot;. Seeing as I used 10mm MDF for the Control Panel top, I had 
to use an additional square of 6mm plywood underneath the spinner as it was 
sticking up too high (the shaft of My Knob was too long!).</font></p>

Knob Mounting</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The 
Tornado Spinner comes highly recommended. Give it a good flick and it spins for 
ages (around two to three minutes) before it stops. Very comfortable and 
accurate. Be warned though, the Slikstik online shop is <u>not</u> friendly to 
International buyers, it took a couple of months and several stuff-ups before I 
got it delivered. If you want to buy one, get in touch with them first regarding 
shipping.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Finishing touches:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Cabinet power is 
provided by a surge-protected powerboard inside the cab, which is wired to a 
standard PC power connector mounted in the back panel. This connector also has a 
fused switch, which means I can plug the cabinet in with a single PC power 
cable. The large green and red buttons mounted under the Control Panel are wired 
into the motherboard's 'Power Switch' and 'Reset' pins. This way, I can flick 
the switch at the back to activate cabinet power (PC, monitor, marquee etc) and 
then press the green button to fire up the PC.</font></p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/Power.jpg">
<img border="0" src="images/PowerThumb.jpg" width="134" height="133"></a></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00">Power Connector/Switch</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The monitor glass is 
standard 6mm window glass; the reverse side has been spray-painted black, with 
the monitor window area masked off. This looks very effective, and is really 
simple to do.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">My wife handled all of 
the spray-painting, and a couple of coats on everything came up trumps. I had 
looked into laminates, but they were way too expensive, as was T-Molding for the 
edges. Maybe sometime in the future, you never know ...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="4" color="#00FFFF">The marquee had to be 
specially made for me by a sign company. I originally intended to get a print 
shop to print it out and mount it myself between two sheets of thin glass, but 
no print shop could handle the dimensions. It was a very expensive way to do it, 
but the result speaks for itself.</font></p>
